          We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data
          uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.

          <strong>PROMOTIONAL OFFERS FROM US</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data
          to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be
          of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and
          offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
        </p>
        <p>
          You will receive marketing communications from us if you have
          requested information from us or made a booking or listing with us and
          you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>THIRD-PARTY MARKETING</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal
          data with any third party for marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>OPTING OUT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages
          at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not
          apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a booking or
          listing.

          <strong>PAYMENTS </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment
          processors) such as Stripe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not store or collect your payment card details. That
          information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors
          whose use of your personal information is governed by their applicable
          privacy policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set
          by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is
          a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
          Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of
          payment information.

        <p>
          We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we

          another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
          purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
          for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please
          contact us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
          notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that we may process your personal data without your
          knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this

          unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access

        <p>
          We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal

          We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
          necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for
          the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or

        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we

        <p>
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
          exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
          fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.

          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
          data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.

        <p>
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
          Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
          particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
          case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

          <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our
          business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give
          you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.
          We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both
          positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal
          data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data
          for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you
          (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to
          by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our
          legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of
          specific activities by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data
          where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you
          are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such
          a contract.

        <p>
          <strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your
          personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal
          obligation that we are subject to.

        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Request access</strong> to your
          personal data (commonly known as a &ldquo;data subject access
          request&rdquo;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal
          data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Request correction</strong> of the
          personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
          incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we
          may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your
          personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
          data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
          You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
          data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
          processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
          unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to
          comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able
          to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons
          which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your
          personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those
          of a third party) and there is something about your particular
          situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground
          as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You
          also have the right to object where we are processing your personal
          data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate
          that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
          which override your rights and freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal
          data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
          personal data in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you want us to establish the data&rsquo;s accuracy.</li>
          <li>
            Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to
            erase it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it
            as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
            whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your
          personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
          third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
          commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only

          Clients may pay on Fashone in several different currencies. Unless
          stated otherwise, you will be charged in the currency displayed on the
          payment page. All currency exchange services in connection with
          payments and withdrawals in local currencies are performed by
          Fashone's Payment Services Providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In certain cases, however, when certain currencies are not supported
          by certain payment methods, you will be charged in US$ even if the
          price is displayed in another currency. In any event, the actual
          charged amount (in the actual payment currency) will be clearly
          disclosed to you before you complete the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users should note that all prices on Fashone are derived always from
          their original US$ price and, therefore, non-US$ currency prices may
          change daily in accordance with exchange rates fluctuations and may
          also include conversion fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients always have the option to pay in US$ by changing their
          selected displayed currency. If you paid for a booking in a currency
          other than US$ and your bookingwas later cancelled for any reason, the
          amount returned to your Fashone balance would be based on the exchange
          rate as of the date of cancellation. Therefore, the returned amount
          may vary from the paid amount in local currency terms, while always
          maintaining the same US$ value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Fashone balance is always valued in US$, even if it is displayed
          in a non-US$ currency. Therefore, should you choose to view your
          Fashone balance in any currency other than US$, it may change daily in
          accordance with exchange rates fluctuations, while always maintaining
          the same US$ value. Users always have the option to view their Fashone
